This project involved implementing a K-nearest-neighbours algorithm in order to classify data, 
The algorithm takes in training data and then classifies the test data into 3 classes based on what attributes it commonly shares
In addtion this project contains a evaluation pdf which describes other methods which could of been used to improve the algorithm
