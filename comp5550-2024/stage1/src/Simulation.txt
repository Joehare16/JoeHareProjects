variables 

R  - rows horizontal
C - vertical streets
T - time goes up by one for every movement 
d - distance minimum numbers of cells car has to pass 
    [a-x] + b-y. so get the starting distance of the car and then 
    work out the difference total cells would be added to the time.
N - pre booked rides:
    1 1 2 3 2 7
    1,1 is start car must travel to here before starting ride. need to work out closest ride to take them 
    2,3 end distance 
    2 time it can start from 
    7 time it m8ust finish by 

scoring system: 
if the car starts at right time then gets 3 points and bonus 
if it starts +1 or +2 from time 3 points 
starts from anywhere higher then this gets 0 points 


must take in a file with the world data then store all of this in constant variables 
after the first row the data is about the car rides 

All vechiles start at 0,0 
vechiles give na list of rides they must complete 

given a file for the cars allocation 
2 2 1 means car 2 has 2 rides ride 2 and ride 1
once the car has completed a ride take most recent of the list

need to mape the ride details given in the world data to the correct ride car
